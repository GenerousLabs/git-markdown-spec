# Git & Markdown

A vision to create a set of simple specifications of how to store structured data in markdown files, stored and transported via git.

- Human readable data is transparent, stable, and future proof.
- Markdown and git are widely used, battle tested, and simple.
- Git makes it easy to "bring your own storage"

Inspired by projects like [hoodie](http://hood.ie) and [nobackend](https://nobackend.org), building on tools like [isomorphic-git](https://isomorphic-git.org), it's possible to build user centric, offline first, private by default apps today.
